My project has to do with the internet speed on campus and it's able to compare the internet speed in 4 different buildings which are Low Rise, Constitution, Mead and Niejadlik hall in different times while using internet apps such as YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify. The internet speed testers are speediest, AT&T, Verizon, and google. In this project 2 upperclassmen halls and two freshman halls are being compared. This project is able to determine an overall "winner" when it comes to which hall has better internet access.
